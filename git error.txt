A much more clever approach to solving the issue as an addon to @ttaylorr suggestion is to do the following.

git remote add origin <yourGitRepoSSHLink>
git remote -v
If you find the fetch and push with a preceding origin returned, then it's fixed.
Do some edits and push using git push origin main or git push origin master

Hope this helps, Good luck.
